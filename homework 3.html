       <p class="second">The main advantage of this site is that each news item is presented in three versions: for people with beginner, intermediate and advanced knowledge levels.

        Each material includes three versions of the text (according to the difficulty levels). An audio recording is attached to the texts of low and intermediate level of complexity, and a video is attached to the text of the advanced level. In each text, words that may be unfamiliar to you are highlighted, they are explained in English. It is noteworthy that the news periodically repeats the same vocabulary, so if you watch just one three-minute video every day, you can gradually expand your vocabulary.
        
        Entry-level audio recordings are voiced by a native speaker, but he speaks clearly, slowly, makes rather long pauses - just what beginners need. If you speak English at an intermediate level, you will hear the recording at a faster pace. For people with an advanced level, original videos are offered, broadcast on American channels: words are pronounced quickly, you can listen to different accents.
